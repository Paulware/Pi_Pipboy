<H1>System Overview</H1>
The lazertag/infra-red system is composed of various components linked together in an Internet of Things local network. <br>
This network is provided by a raspberry pi 3 running an apache web-server.  Game devices log into the pi via a 
wifi (esp8266) component.  Infra-red shots are created by an arduino.  Shots are detected by the same arduino
who then reports this action to the raspberry pi.  The pi allocates damage, updates its database (mysql) and sends 
a message back to "hit" the arduino and deal damage.  This reduces the player's health points which can then result in 
the "death" of the player. 

<H1>Game Overview</H1>
   Players are assigned teams (red/green/blue) and typically start at a spawn point.  They may navigate to a capture point, bomb location or to intercept enemy players.
Along the way they may encounter ammo, or health crates.  When a player's health is low they can use a stimpak to increase 
health.  When their ammunition is low they can reload using a reload kit.  When a player's health is reduced to zero
they are consider "killed" and must return to their spawn point to reuse their next life (if available).
  
   An entire team is eliminated when all members of that team have lost their last life.
   Games are won when only 1 team remains or all flags have been captured by a single team.
<h2>Supported Games</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Death Match (Every man for himself)</b></li>
There may be respawns or no respawns.  The game is won when 1 player remains.
<li><b>Team Death Match</b></li>
The game is won when 1 team remains.
<li><b>Capture the flag</b></li>
The game is won when 1 team has captured all the flags.
<li>Escort the VIP (Coming soon)</li>
The game is won when the VIP reaches a spawn point or is killed.
<li>Disarm the bomb (Coming soon)</li>
The game is won when the bomb is placed at a specific point and counts down, or the bomb is killed.
<li>Trouble in terrorist town (Coming soon)<li>
There are 3 player types: Terrorist, Police and Detective.  The terrorists win when all the police are killed. 
The police win when all the terrorists are killed.  The detective wins when the Police win.  The detective can ask
you if you are a terrorist or not.  If a police kills a police man, both die.  If a terrorist kills a terrorist, both 
die.
</ul>

<h1>Some requirements:</H1>
   <ul>
   <li>The raspberry server will broadcast its ip address via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">udp</a> to all connected devices</li>
   <li>Each lazer tag gun will have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266">esp8266</a> which logs to the local pipboy network with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_(802.11_network)#Service_set_identification_.28SSID.29">SSID</a>="Pipboy2000" Password=""</li>
   <li>Each connected device will display color green when it receives receives the raspberry pi server's ip address</li>
